# Everyday Activities

When creating recordings for 1-2 Project Aria device wearers, we created scripts to represent all day long activities with always on sensing. Each script contained multiple scenarios that told a story about people going through their day. The scripts provided general guidance for an improvised scenario, actors did not have specific lines to learn, instead they followed prompts and went with what felt most natural to to them.


* Script 1: Lazy Morning Before the Party – Single Wearer
* Script 2: Catch Up and Have Some Fun – Two Wearers
* Script 3: What Do You Want For Dinner? – Two Wearers
* Script 4: Easy Like Sunday Morning – Single Wearer
* Script 5: Get Home then Get Going – Single Wearer

Data was recorded in multiple locations across the USA and all scripts except for script 10 were recorded multiple times.

See [Recording Scripts](pilotdata/everyday/scripts.md) for details about the scenarios in each script.


## Recording Sessions

We collected these scripted activities with multiple users in four indoor location across the USA.
